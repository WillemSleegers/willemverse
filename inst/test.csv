First, DEI felt like something that appeared into the limelight out of nowhere with the past ten years due to business adopting it, but it shouldn't be treated as such. One of the constant struggles I believe DEI/JEID faces in its reputation is that it feels as if it is something being implemented top-down, even if many people largely agree with the need for it. The difficult part is ensuring that JEID is not just communicated top-down, but it feels as if it is being brought from bottom-up, in a genuine, bona fide manner. Thus, as the JEID committee develops its bylaws, goals, and policies, I believe that it is important to remember this.

Second, part of JEID I believe is not discussed as prominently is power. We believe that power is sanctioned and controlled from a central figure (like a ruler), but according to Michel Foucault, power is actualized, exercised, and experienced in the perimeters and extremities of the system, and we should see power as something that everyone has in varying, unequal degrees (Foucault, ""Power, Right, Truth""). This means that the insight and analysis of power is most important when we look at how, for example, a white working-class person discriminates against a black person, instead of looking at how the US Congress' explicit discriminatory policies subjugates disadvantaged peoples. In other words, discriminatory policies and discrimination in general are not the result of a single person/subjugator/ruler, but the product of a system that subjugates us and that we simultaneously contribute to. So, in creating policies and more generally, culture-building, everyone should feel included in contributing to the organization and feel empowered to exercise their power in an equitable, non-zero-sum game manner while recognizing the stratified nature of power in our society.

In the end, there aren't any solid suggestions that I'm communicating here, but I hope that my opinion can reveal more insight and things to keep in mind as JEID develops its goals.","For the race and ethnicity section of the survey, add an additional comments section so people can elaborate on their identity.

However, it does seem like it doesn't adequately take into account how work is likely to be affected for anyone bearing a child, vs other parents. I think the two things that strike me the most are the following. 1) Our policy says that ""leave can be taken as desired within the first two years of a new child’s life"", which suggests that the leave cannot begin before the child is born/ adopted? It might be beneficial for parents to begin a few weeks beforehand. 2) According to the policy, ""pay and hours for the parental leave will be the average of the pay you received over the two month prior notice period"". If a child bearing parent needs to reduce hours in the late stages of pregnancy - because they simply cannot keep up with a full time job - then it seems that this will impact their earning potential for the period of their leave. In contrast, a non-child-bearing parent would probably be able to continue to work full hours and therefore receive higher pay.
